    "text": "2.1.1 Youth\nIn this report, we use the term “youth” to refer to individuals of working age (15 to 29). This is consistent with definitions used by Statistics Canada and the International Labour Organization.\n\n\n2.1.2 Newcomer\nThis report defines newcomers as immigrants to Canada who landed 10 or fewer years prior to the reference year. Conventional definitions of newcomers use a 5-year window, but the LFS PUMF does not distinguish between immigrants who landed 5 or fewer years ago and those who landed 6 to 10 years ago.\n\n\n2.1.3 School Months\nCurrent enrollment in either high school or post-secondary education is one dimension of the segmentation model developed below. While the LFS PUMF variable SCHOOLN indicates current attendance, it does indicate current enrollment. This means that, for example, a student who is on summer break would be classified as not currently attending school, even though they are still enrolled. To address this issue, we limit impacted components of the analysis to typically active university terms (September to May).",

Of note is the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth employment and participation rates in 2020, and their slower recovery compared to non-youth. Whether this portends a long-term shift in the labour market remains to be seen, but it is clear that youth entering or returning to the labour market in the near future will encounter a different landscape than their pre-pandemic counterparts.\n\n2.3.1 Labour market rate indicators\nTable 2.1 presents annualized average rates of participation, employment, unemployment, enrollment, and NEET status among youth in Canada from 2015 to 2024.\nIt suggests the following:\n\nYouth participation and employment rates are consistently lower than those of the non-youth population.\nNEET rates among youth are consistently lower due to much higher rates of enrollment in education.\nYouth participation, employment, and NEET rates jumped in 2020, but have largely recovered to pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\n\nShow code\ngt_spanners &lt;- function(g, ...) {\n  g_ &lt;- g\n\n  spanners &lt;- rlang::list2(...)\n\n  purrr::iwalk(\n    spanners, \n    function(pattern, label) {\n      g_ &lt;&lt;- g_ |&gt; \n        gt::tab_spanner(\n          label = label, \n          columns = matches(pattern)\n        )\n    }\n  )\n  g_\n}\n\nlfs_source_note &lt;- function(g, u = \"Working-age population (15-64)\") {\n  g |&gt; \n    gt::tab_source_note(\n      source_note = \"Source: Labour Force Survey Public Use Microdata File (LFS PUMF), Statistics Canada\"\n    ) |&gt; \n    gt::tab_source_note(\n      source_note = glue::glue(\"Universe: {u}\")\n    )\n}\n\n\nt01 &lt;- d |&gt; \n  filter(school_month) |&gt; \n  group_by(SURVYEAR, youth_fct) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    participation = weighted.mean(participating_lgl, FINALWT),\n    employment = weighted.mean(employed_lgl, FINALWT),\n    unemployment = weighted.mean(unemployed_lgl, FINALWT, na.rm = TRUE),\n    enrollment = weighted.mean(enrolled_lgl, FINALWT),\n    neet = weighted.mean(neet_lgl, FINALWT)\n  ) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'SURVYEAR'.
